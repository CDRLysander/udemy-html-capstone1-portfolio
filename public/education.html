                <h2>University of Macedonia - BSc in Applied Informatics (Complete)</h2>
                <h3>Grade: 6.28/10</h3>
                <h3>ECTS Value on completion: 250</h3>
                <p>I completed this degree on the span of 8.5 years, from September of 2015 to February of 2024. I studied on an on-off basis, due to intermittent work, mandatory military service and a few other hiccups, hence the long timeframe.</p>

                <h2>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - BSc in Policial Science (TBC)</h2>
                <h3>Grade: TBA</h3>
                <h3>ECTS Value on completion: 240 (estimated)</h3>
                <p>This is the second degree I've started working towards. I decided on an entirely different field due to political science being a long time interest and due to intellectual fatigue from getting the Applied Informatics degree, which, while extrememly useful, turned out to be not quite what I had expected and a relative loss of interest ensued.</p>
